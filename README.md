# Diversity forecasting for Breeding Bird Survey

Research project code for data-intensive approaches to making forecasts for
biodiversity.


## Running the code

To fully run this code you will need R, a number of R packages including some
development releases, and the Jupyter Notebook.

If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed already we recommend installing the
[Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to get it.

Running `install-packages.R` should make sure all of the relevant packages are
installed including Jupyter Notebook integration. It will not re-install
packages that you already have thanks to
[pacman](https://github.com/trinker/pacman).

Once everything is installed launch a Jupyter Notebook, using either the start
menu of `jupyter notebook` from the command line, and run
`forecasting-bbs-R.ipynb`.
